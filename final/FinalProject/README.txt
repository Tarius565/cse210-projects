The program is a simple budget manager program. There are 4 types that can be entered: 
Income, Expense, Savings, Debt. These four contain a name, an amount, and a third variable
that is unique for each of the budget types (source, category, goal, source respectively).
The menu is used to get around to the various options. You can add a budget item, edit
a budget item, remove a budget item, review the current budget, save the current budget,
or load a budget. With these options, creating and/or adjusting budgets should be very simple
and beneficial.
