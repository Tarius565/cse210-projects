From a glance the program is a budget manager. It will accept inputs that will be categorized depending on the details (expense, income, savings, etc).
The program will have a function that will save the data out to a .txt or .csv file where it can be easily accessed and changed via the program.
The program will not use a GUi at all so it will be just terminal based for navigation and display.

Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism will all be used. Abstraction will be used through the separate classes having their own individual attributes.
Encapsulation will be implemented by protecting those attributes from the separate classes so they cannot be changed directly.
Inheritance is implemented by grouping all of the inputs together into a budget type class (ie expenses and savings being under an income class).
Polymorphism will be implemented since each of the different types of budget items will have a different way of being displayed (ie expenses and savings will show positive and
negative values).
